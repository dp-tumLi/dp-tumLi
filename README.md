## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @dp-tumLi

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a research assistant currently working and student formerly studying Mechatronics and Robotics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).  

ðŸ¤– My main interests revolve around:
- **Robotics systems design**: elastic cable-driven actuation, compliant mechanisms
- **Modeling & Control**: nonlinear dynamics, passivity-based control, nonlinear control theory, optimal control
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: safe physical interaction, teleoperation, surgical robots
- **SLAM & Navigation**: robust autonomous behavior in complex environments
- **Learning for Robotics**: flow/diffusion model in motion planning&control, generative sampling-based control

ðŸ’¡ **Looking to collaborate on:**  
Open-source projects, novel control frameworks, learning-enhanced planning, or anything that pushes safe, reliable robot autonomy forward. I'm always up for a good discussion on bridging model-based control with learning!

ðŸ“« **Reach me:**  
Feel free to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-li-730957240/) or open an issue in one of my repos.
